## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **‚öôÔ∏è Architecture**     | The codebase follows a modular design, with separate files for different functionalities such as server control, LED management, and effects. It implements the FastAPI framework to create a RESTful API for controlling the LEDs.                                  |
| **üìñ Documentation**    | TBD                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **üîó Dependencies**     | The core dependencies for the system are the `FastAPI` library for creating the RESTful API and the `adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel` library for controlling the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins. These dependencies are essential for the system to interact with the LED lights and expose the functionality through the API. |
| **üß© Modularity**       | The codebase demonstrates a decent level of modularity, organizing different functionalities into separate files. This allows components to be developed and maintained independently, making it easier to extend or modify specific parts of the system.                                |
| **‚úîÔ∏è Testing**          | The code lacks explicit tests. The creation of unit tests to verify the behavior and correctness of individual functionalities, as well as integration tests to ensure the system works as a whole, could enhance stability and maintainability.                                          |
| **‚ö°Ô∏è Performance**      | Since the codebase is designed for controlling LED lights, the impact on hardware resources such as CPU and memory should be minimal.                                           |
| **üîê Security**         | No access control has been implemented for the API server at the moment.          |                                                         |
| **üîå Integrations**     | A user TUI client is being developed.                 |
